+ Iterate when needed for emotional development and stability through:
1. Receiving: Become aware, inquire, choose, follow, identify, locate and reply
2. Responding: React to, answer, assist, comply, discuss and report
3. Valuing: Complete, differentiate, explain, justify, propose, select and share
4. Organizing: Arranging, combine, compare, complete, explain, identify, integrate and modify
5. Characterizing:  Act, discriminate, modify, perform, practice, quantify, question, revise and verify
+ Iterate when needed for motoric skills through:
1. Perception and awareness: Choose, describe, distinguish, identify, isolate, relate and select
2. Set: Begin, display, explain, proceed, react and show
3. Guided response: Follow instructions, copy, trace, follow, reproduce and respond
4. Mechanism (basic proficiency): Assemble, calibrate, dismantle, fasten, fix, manipulate, measure, mix and organize
5. Complex overt response (expertise): Assemble, calibrate, dismantle, fasten, fix and manipulate
6. Adaptation (strong independent skills): Adapt, alter, change, rearrange, reorganize and revise
7. Origination (creativity): Arrange, build, combine, compose, construct, create, design and originate
+ Iterate when needed for cognitive skills through:
1. Remember: This stage of learning is about memorizing basic facts, dates, events, persons, places, concepts and patterns.
The associated cognitive processes, as already noted, are:
Recognizing means locating knowledge in long-term memory related to presented material (e.g., recognizing the dates of important historical events).
Recalling is retrieving knowledge from long-term memory (e.g., recalling the dates of important historical events).
2. Understand: At this point, learners might be asked to explain a concept in their own words, describe a mathematical graph or clarify a metaphor.
The processes associated with understanding are:
Interpreting implies changing from one form of representation to another. It might be transforming numerical information into verbal.
Exemplifying is finding a specific illustration of a concept or principle. It may be giving several examples of Suprematist paintings.
Classifying is determining a category of something. An example is the classification of mental disorders.
Summarizing means retrieving a general theme of significant points (e.g., writing a short summary of a story).
Inferring is drawing a logical conclusion from given information. It may be formulating grammatical principles of a foreign language from the presented examples.
Comparing is finding correspondences between two ideas or objects (e.g., comparing historical events to their contemporary analogues).
Explaining is constructing a cause-and-effect model of a system, for example, explaining the causes of the French Revolution.
3. Apply: Now, it’s time to use learned facts and abstractions in new contexts and particular situations.
For example, students might be asked to discuss phenomena described in one scientific paper using terms and concepts of another paper.
The processes of cognition corresponding to this stage are:
Executing is applying a procedure to a familiar task (e.g., calculating the root of a number).
Implementing is about applying a procedure to an unfamiliar task (e.g., using Newton’s Second Law in a new situation).
4. Analyze: At this level, students are supposed to break down concepts and examine their relationships.
For instance, they might be asked to recognize the genre of a painting or describe the leading causes of the Great Depression.
The three particular processes associated with this stage are:
Differentiating means distinguishing important from unimportant parts of presented material (e.g., distinguishing between relevant and irrelevant numbers in a mathematical word problem).
Organizing involves identifying how elements fit or function within a structure (e.g., finding the hypothesis, method, data and conclusion in a research report).
Attributing means determining a point of view, bias, values, or intent underlying presented material. An example would be to identify the author’s point of view of an essay.
5. Evaluate: In this stage, learners are expected to use their knowledge and skills to appraise a situation, justify their stand or criticize others’ opinions. They should be able to point out logical fallacies in arguments or compare a work to the highest standards in its field.
They might be asked, for example:
In your opinion, is online piracy ethical?
Do you consider jazz music to be high art?
What are the most absurd arguments against vegetarianism?
Evaluating is divided into checking and critiquing.
Checking means detecting inconsistencies or fallacies in a process or product. For example, it’s determining if a scientist’s conclusions follow from observed data.
Critiquing involves finding inconsistencies between a product and external criteria. For instance, it’s judging which of two methods is the best for solving a problem.
6. Create: This is the most complex stage of the learning process and the top of the revised Bloom’s Taxonomy.
At this level, learners combine known patterns, ideas and facts to create original work or formulate their solution to a problem.
They might be asked to compose a song, rewrite a story in another setting or formulate a hypothesis and propose a way of testing it.
The three associated cognitive processes are:
Generating involves coming up with alternative hypotheses based on criteria. An example might be devising multiple solutions for a social problem.
Planning is about coming up with a procedure for completing a task (e.g., preparing an outline of an article).
Producing means inventing a product (e.g., writing a short story that takes place during the American Revolution).


Example:
Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy Model (Responsive)
Note: These are learning objectives – not learning activities. It may be useful to think of preceding each objective with something like, “students will be able to…:
